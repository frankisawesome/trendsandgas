# Gas and trends

## Motivation
To better visualise gas spendings post 🍠

## API Usage
Etherscan public api (no spamming)

## Usage
Either head to the deployed address (0.0.0.0) or pull the docker image `docker pull franklyawesome/gastrends:latest` and run on 3001 -> this will still call api running on my f1 micro tier gcp vm, so if that fails, just clone the repo, get your own etherscan api key, add key and port to a dot env, and run everything local.

## Future
More functionalities on the graph? More scalable deployment? Give me ideas!
